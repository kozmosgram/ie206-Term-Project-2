Introduction of the Project

Hospitals need a schedule to show their operations. While doing this, they use data such as the
number of operation rooms, the day of the operation, the priority of the patient, and when it will
start and end. When these data are ignored, it can lead to bad results such as overlaps in
operations, decrease in efficiency, and decrease in patient satisfaction. Therefore, a good
operation plan is very important for both the hospital and the patients. In this project, we will
make the operation schedule of the hospital called 'Metu Hospital' as the operations are desired.
We have been given an excel table with information about the patients who will be operated on.
In this table, the patient's name, surname, ID number, the day of the operation, the time interval
for the operation, the duration of the operation, and the complexity of the operation are included.
There are 3 rooms in total in the Metu Hospital where we can perform these operations. We are
asked for an operation schedule in which we place the patients according to the available time
intervals using the information that we received from the excel table. These charts were requested
to be in the form of Gantt Chart. In addition, we were asked to make these operation schedule
separately according to 3 different objectives. The first objective is to maximize the number of
operations which is completed within its initial available time interval. The second objective is to 
maximize the utilization of the rooms. The third objective is to minimize the late completion time.
We aim to schedule 3 different objectives by using object-oriented programming with MATLAB.
